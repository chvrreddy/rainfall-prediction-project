# Rainfall Prediction Project 🌧️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset is analyzed, preprocessed, and fed into various ML models to forecast whether it will rain or not.  
The notebook `Rain_fall_prediction.ipynb` contains the full workflow including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
